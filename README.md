Nefarius' [n≈èvƒ´cƒ≠us](https://latinitium.com/latin-dictionaries/?t=lsn31290) universal software updater agent for Windows.

## About

vƒ´cƒ≠us is a self-contained C++20 executable acting as a software update agent for Microsoft Windows. It can be deployed alongside your product and will take care of periodically checking for newer versions online and notifying the user of pending updates. Its goal is to require the least amount of configuration to get it up and running while providing enough flexibility to be customized for various environments, if desired. It doesn't require any prerequisites being present on the target system and should be able to run on any recent Windows version.

## Motivation

Dealing with software update mechanics has been a steady companion for almost 10 years by now, so it's about time to learn from all the mistakes, hardships and shortcomings the various products used have put me through all this time üòÖ If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself üí™

## Features

- **No backend application server required**
  All you need on the server-side to get going is a web host supporting delivering static JSON files and you're done. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) would be a sufficient free hosting solution where you can upload to and deliver the updater configuration from. Take a look at the [example server implementation](examples/server) if you wish to write your own backend service.
- **Self-contained**
  No need to worry if .NET or other runtimes are present on the target machines, everything it needs is delivered in a single Win32 executable.
- **(Almost) zero configuration**
  The bare minimum configuration can be provided by simply compiling in the server URL by adjusting the `CustomizeMe.h` header file. This does not mean you need to maintain one build for every product you wanna support; you will get **multi-tenancy out of the box** by simply naming the resulting executable after the following scheme: `manufacturer_product_Updater.exe`, e.g. `nefarius_HidHide_Updater.exe` will build the server path as `https://example.org/api/nefarius/HidHide/updates.json` (or however it is defined in `CustomizeMe.h`) automatically!
  - All alternative, more sophisticated configuration options [are described in the extended documentation](https://docs.nefarius.at/projects/Vicius/Server-Discovery/).
  - If you wish to completely avoid touching the cloned sources [have a look at the optional includes](include/README.md).
- **Sane defaults**
  We hate wasting time writing configuration files as much as the next person; most configuration options are either optional or have sane default fallback values you can depend on.
- **Self-updater**
  Sometimes just the updater process needs an update (e.g. security patches), not the entire product it is watching over. It can update itself if the server-provided instance version is higher than the locally running one.
- **Self-healing**
  If run in autostart when the user logs on, it can make sure that scheduled tasks and other supportive components are configured and working properly.
- **Low resource consumption**
  The updater process is only invoked on demand (at user logon and once per day via Task Scheduler) and doesn't keep running in the background.
- **Respects your time**
  Busy fragging in a game? We won't bother you with any popup windows until you're ready.
- **Powerful template engine included**
  Sometimes finding the local resource of interest to check the product version can be more challenging than just having a static, boring file path. You can use [inja](https://github.com/pantor/inja) templates to build your own path resolving logic, all while never having to leave your JSON strings!
- **Expressive modern changelog support**
  Update summaries a.k.a. changelogs don't have to be boring slabs of text; [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is fully supported! The included fonts are also capable of rendering [Fork Awesome icons](https://forkaweso.me/Fork-Awesome/) and [**system-provided emojis**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/segoe-ui-emoji)! üéâ ü•≥ üçï

## Prerequisites

- Windows 7 or later (x86, x86_64, ARM64)
  - **Note:** currently anything below Windows 10 is untested and low priority
- An NTFS formatted volume
- An Internet connection
- Your software updates packaged in some sort of setup or self-extractor
  Use something like [WiX](https://wixtoolset.org/), [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php), [Advanced Installer](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/), [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download) or similar to package your updates into setups.

## Documentation

Head over to the [extended documentation](https://docs.nefarius.at/projects/Vicius/) for examples and detailed explanations.

## Downloads

You can get [unsigned build snapshots here](https://buildbot.nefarius.at/builds/vicius/latest/bin/). Consider these Nightly-releases.

Signed stable releases will be provided [on the repository releases page](../../releases/). Keep in mind though that those releases are built to use my own update infrastructure so in 99% of the cases you probably don't want to use them, at least not without a configuration file!

## How to build

Set up Visual Studio 2022 or newer with the C++ Desktop Development workload.

To get binary compression to work [upx](https://upx.github.io/) has to be installed. You can do so via e.g.:

```PowerShell
winget install upx
```

### Multi-tenant build example

You do not have to touch the checked out sources if you wish to customize your build.

Assuming a manufacturer name `Valkirie` and product name `HandheldCompanion`, create the following folder structure and file `.\include\Valkirie\HandheldCompanion\ViciusPostCustomizeMe.h` and override the server url in there like so:

```cpp
#undef NV_API_URL_TEMPLATE
#define NV_API_URL_TEMPLATE     "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Valkirie/HandheldCompanion/main/Valkirie_HandheldCompanion_Updates.json"
```

Now you can build from the command line pointing the compiler to the directory of your header(s) like so:

```PowerShell
msbuild .\src\vƒ´cƒ≠us.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release /p:CustomIncludes="${PWD}\include\Valkirie\HandheldCompanion\" /p:UpdaterName=Valkirie_HandheldCompanion_Updater
```

This will produce the binary `Valkirie_HandheldCompanion_Updater.exe` with the server URL of your custom header file baked into it!

You're of course free to put the custom header files anywhere on your system (like your own private repository), they do not need to be put under the project root directory.
